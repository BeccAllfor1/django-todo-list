This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post tasks, comment/respond to tasks allocated to them and have an organised easy to read and understand management system to refer to. This project has been built for the purpose of helping busy families who are looking for a task management solution, to ease their day to day lives, and assit in freeing up time to spend with their families.

# About
Family Organiser is a application where users can allocate tasks and access an organised and easy to use task management system. Many families in todays society have very busy lives, both parents may work, children have after school clubs, hobbies and social events. Its a struggle to stay organised, events, parties or clubs can be missed causing stress and arguments. The family organiser app keeps a record of not only what tasks need to be done but also who is responsible for carrying out the task, this eliminates confusion, keeping a track of who is doing what and when. Freeing up time to enjoy other activities and removing stress and arguments .

This page is primarily targeted at busy families who are looking for a task management solution, to ease their day to day lives, but can be utilised by anyone and everyone who are looking for an easy to use task management solution.

# UX
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'Family Organiser' are:

- Families in todays society have very busy lives
- Anyone looking for an easy to use management system
- Parents who work long hours or who struggle due to shift work to have regular conversations about social events or childrens activities and need a tool to keep each other updated.


These users will be looking for:
- An easy to use website, with tasks that are easy to read and easy-to-find 
- A website that offers a way to communicate what tasks are upcoming
- Ability to make a user account in order to interact with the site content
- Ability to allocate tasks to each other,
- Ability to communicate an update or provide a response regarding the task,
- Ability to update the allocated tasks, and a way to remove the tasks when complete.

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and conformability of use.

This was tested by accessing the Django Admin Panel. By creating a Superuser we can access the Django Admin Panel where the administrator can perform all the CRUD functionalities


## Bugs and Issues
- I had a problem where my edit button would not function. 
The error was corrected by moving the cancel and confirm button so it was inside the form.

- Clicked the green â€˜newâ€™ button. This takes you to the create new repository page.
- Once there under â€˜repository templateâ€™ I chose the code institute template from the dropdown menu.
