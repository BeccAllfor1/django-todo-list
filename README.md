This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post tasks, comment/respond to tasks allocated to them and have an organised easy to read and understand, management system to refer to. This project has been built for the purpose of helping busy families who are looking for a task management solution, to ease their day to day lives, and assist in freeing up time to spend with their families.

# About
Family Organiser is a application where users can allocate tasks and access an organised and easy to use task management system. Many families in todays society have very busy lives, both parents may work, children have after school clubs, hobbies and social events. Its a struggle to stay organised, events, parties, or clubs can be missed causing stress and arguments. The family organiser app keeps a record of not only what tasks need to be done but also who is responsible for carrying out the task, this eliminates confusion, keeping a track of who is doing what and when. Freeing up time to enjoy other activities and removing stress and arguments .

This page is primarily targeted at busy families who are looking for a task management solution, to ease their day to day lives, but can be used by anyone who is looking for an easy use task management solution.

# UX
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'Family Organiser' are:

- Families in todays society have very busy lives
- Anyone looking for an easy to use management system
- Parents who work long hours or who struggle due to shift work to have regular conversations about social events or childrens activities and need a tool to keep each other 
 updated.


These users will be looking for:
- An easy to use website, with tasks that are easy to read and easy-to-find 
- A website that offers a way to communicate what tasks are upcoming
- Ability to make a user account in order to interact with the site content
- Ability to allocate tasks to each other,
- Ability to communicate an update or provide a response regarding the task,
- Ability to update the allocated tasks, and a way to remove the tasks when complete.

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and conformability of use.

## Design 

## Chosen Color 
<p align="center">
 - All colours were based around Keppel
<img src="static/images/color.png" width="800" height="300">
</p>

- **white** - navbar background colour fits in with the minimalist feel of the site.
- **#ac9141** - buttons colour. I choose this color because it contrasts and stands out nicely with footer .
- **white** - body site colour. Fits nicely with the rest of the page. I choose to keep this plain as it does distract from the content.
- **white** - background colour for Sign Up/Sign In forms. I choose this colour again as it keeps the focus on the form.
- **#419c91** - footer background color, adds colour without removing focus.
- **#9c415c** - Alert colour to stand out and grab users attention.
- **#419c91** - Task input form to stand out and contrast with the footer
- **419c91** - Task forms to contrast with the input box but match with the footer.
- **#df8fa7** - Tasks change to this colour when hovered over to indicate they are selected, it matches the scheme but stands out.

This was tested by accessing the Django Admin Panel. By creating a Superuser we can access the Django Admin Panel where the administrator can perform all the CRUD functionalities


## Bugs and Issues
- I had a problem where my edit button would not function. 
  The error was corrected by moving the cancel and confirm button so it was inside the form.

- I had a bottom scroll appear on my organiser page so solved this by adding 
 a container-fluid.

- My styling was not applying to the h1 in index.html, i discovered this was 
 due to the center tag, so i removed this and used css instead.

- Had an issue with the submit button, there had been a center element used  which is now obsolete, fixed it by using css.

# Deployment
This project was deployed using Github and Heroku.

## Github 
To create a new repository I took the following steps:

- Logged into Github.
- Clicked over to the â€˜repositoriesâ€™ section.
- Clicked the green â€˜newâ€™ button. This takes you to the create new repository page.
- Once there under â€˜repository templateâ€™ I chose the code institute template from the dropdown menu.
- I input a repository name then clicked the green â€˜create repository buttonâ€™ at the bottom of the page.
- Once created I opened the new repository and clicked the green â€˜Gitpodâ€™ button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

## Django and Heroku 
- To get the Django framework installed and set up I followed the Code institutes [Django Blog cheatsheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)
